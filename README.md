hdw.dat files for SuperDARN radars

Readme file for the hdw.dat repository.

The originally repository was setup by Kevin Sterne at Virginia Tech in order
to update the way hdw.dat files are maintained in the SuperDARN 
community. **This repository will currently not get all new hardware file update. 
The plan is to make this repository to the primary hardware and radar.dat repository. 
To move forward some scripts will need to be changed.** 

The idea is that each institution is probably the best
source for their own radar's hdw.dat file and any applicable changes
to that file.  So, this respository will allow institutions to 
make updates to their hdw.dat file and allow other institutions to
download the latest version of the hdw.dat file.
